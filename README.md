# ANN-Based Projects ‚Äì Churn Classification & Salary Prediction

Welcome to this repository where I have implemented **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** using TensorFlow and deployed two real-world machine learning applications using **Streamlit**.

---

## Project Overview

This repo contains two separate machine learning projects:

1. **Exited Classification** (`exited_classification.py`)  
   Predicts whether a customer will exit the bank or not (Binary Classification).

2. **Salary Regression** (`salary_regression.py`)  
   Predicts a person's estimated salary based on features (Regression Problem).

**[Estimated Salary Prediction (Regression App)](https://your-regression-app-link.com)**
